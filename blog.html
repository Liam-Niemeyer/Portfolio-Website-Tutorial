	<img class="blogimage" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-blog/assets/03-2013-new-experience.png" />
	<p> I admit, a journalism school education can be a bit overwhelming, especially for an easily overwhelmed person like me. From the idea of the "print journalism business model" to how memes might be our saving grace (I'd love to see a link on this phrase), it can be a confusing time in understanding how to be a journalist -- more importantly how to be a good one. </p>

<p> Usually outsiders from the media world think being a journalist is pretty basic at face value: writing, reporting, and getting the facts right. Yet, I've found there are skills even my fellow student journalists are still learning on the spot. </p> 

<h4> My Friend Was A Professional Hacker </h4>
<p>Flashback to the summer of 2014 -- I'm sitting in the dusty, dark basement of my friend's house in the middle of a sweltering June, and as usual, we were bored. I was laid out on the couch, cradling a lukewarm Mountain Dew; my friend, Ben Kissinger, was tinkering with his laptop.</p> 

<p>He was messing with some code on this one website with the code shown in multiple colors. I was curious, as the couch wasn't of much interest.

<p >"What the hell are you doing," I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, you know, hacking into the Federal Government."</p>

<p>"Ah, make sure to put my ex on the No Fly List while you're at it."</p>

<p>And that's how most of our daily banter went. But I was little more than curious about it, so I persisted. He pointed me in the direction of Codecademy, and I fiddled with Python and HTML code for a solid two hours. And then I dropped it. It was neat, but it wasn't anything near the magicalness of binge-watching Netflix or jamming on the saxophone.</p>

<p>Besides, I wouldn't need any fancy hacker skills in journalism school for my upcoming first semester of college, I thought. I closed my eyes, took a sip of stale soda and envisioned the epic stories involving explosions and political sex scandals I would be covering down at Ohio University.</p>

<h4>The "New" Journalism</H4>
<p>So, my 2014-self wasn't entirely right. I'm not covering political sex scandals. But also, the use of code hasn't escaped me. With news projects such as "Snowfall" and work by Pro Publica, the possibilities with how a story can be told digitally have expanded vastly, and journalism schools across the country have slowly been integrating code into their curriculum.</p>

<p>Even at Ohio University, the School of Visual Communication has opened up Web Design courses to journalism majors that were previously only available to students in the school.</p> 

<p>I now see the value of HTML5 and CSS knowledge in a journalist's education, but only to a certain extent. Today's media world is one that is digitally-based, and one shouldn't ignore the basic foundation that makes up our digital world. But being a "journalist" doesn't necessarily have to mean being a "web design expert."</p>

<p>"I don't think there's great value in teaching programming to everyone unless they want to learn it," Danylo Berko said in a American Journalism Review article. Berko went on to say how certain things have always mattered in journalism, like reporting skills, while learning code might just be the trend of the times.</p>

<p>I agree. It's important to be able to talk code. It's important to learn code and be able to mess around with. But to be the next web design godsend? Maybe not, unless that's your passion. </p>

<p>But from one journalist to another, give code a try. You might find a whole new way of being a journalist. </p>

	<h2 style="font-family:'Raleway', sans-serif"> <strong> Where Coding and Journalism Collide: The Unicorns of Digital Media </strong> </h2>
<img class="blogimage" src="http://static.tumblr.com/52969866b600908b4b4dbdb8bb17df62/ytea0ls/pPcn3327p/tumblr_static_dfc3fd463453b5b63485f5bc57b2ba3c.jpg" />
<p> My friend, Rahul, is a unicorn. </p>

<p> No, he doesn't have a gleaming, sparkling pearl horn sticking out of his head. No, he can't gallop through fields with a magical aura. But what he can do is something that makes him stick out in the media field like a sore thumb, and already has newspapers and media organizations fighting over him for internships. </p>

<p> Rahul is a coder and designer. He can create a website from scratch with HTML, CSS and a little ingenuity. But he also can think like a journalist -- he's contributed writing to multiple articles and data journalism projects over the two years that I've known him. </p>

<p> Why is this combination so valuable? </p>

<p> Media organizations need people who are expert coders for hosting digital content and also people who can tell stories to go out in the digital sphere. And in an online world where code-heavy narratives like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek">"Snowfall"</a> have become a norm, having a person who can tell the story and create the platform for the story is truly like finding a unicorn driving down the highway. </p>

<p> For most journalists, it would be great if one could have a mastery of both skills. With the <a href="http://onmedia.dw-akademie.com/english/?p=17945">opportunities online</a> available, it can be done. But for most people, the drive to teach yourself to be a full-blown designer or programmer is found in few people. Some people don't have the time to dedicate towards the effort, as he or she is too busy creating content for the web. Unicorns are rare for a reason. That doesn't mean you have to be one to be a successful digital journalist.

<p> <a href="http://www.poynter.org/2015/19-million-project-brings-journalists-coders-and-humanitarians-together-around-the-migration-crisis/384400/">The 19 Million Project</a> is a good example of this. 150 people from international media organizations came together in Rome this past November to help cover the migrant and refugee crisis happening across the Middle East and Europe. In the process of covering this crisis, journalists, designers and coders were able to successfully work together to create content and present in online for the world to see. </p>

<p> The journalists involved in this project didn't need to be masters of HTML and CSS, but they had to understand the basis of it to work with coders on how to present stories online. They didn't have to walk the walk, but they had to talk the talk. </p>

<p> That's why journalists should have at least a basis of understanding in coding -- it's the medium where their stories live. Journalism students should  <a href="http://mediashift.org/2015/01/why-journalism-students-need-a-baseline-understanding-of-coding/">be required to take one coding class</a> to gain this understanding. They should be able to look at HTML code and be able to manipulate it to a certain extent. By seeing journalism through the same eyes of coders, the digital content experience can be more fluid and effortless in its process. But a journalist isn't required to also be a programmer to be successful. </p>

<p> In other words, you don't have to be a unicorn. But making an effort to be one never hurts. </p>
